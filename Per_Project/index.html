          Welcome to my personal blog, a public access point to my inner thoughts,
          a website I created where ironically I get to do all of the expressing.
          I've always enjoyed writing and I've found that getting my ideas down on
          paper has helped me better organize my thoughts and get a sense of what
          I'm truly feeling.

          <br> <br>
          With that being said, most of my writings will be about life - God, society,
          culture, good and evil because they are the most difficult topics and the easiest
          to question. Many of the most important aspects of life we fail to ask
          ourselves 'why?' and just accept 'reality' as it is. We accept what we
          believe to be truth and act as if there are no means of change. We
          accept that the world works in certain ways but don't care to
          understand why.

          <br> <br>
          Please remember, this is a personal blog of <i> my</i> thoughts and <i> my</i>
          ideas. I may be wrong at times and I will probably say things that will embarrass
          myself at others. I may also come across as egotistical and having it all together,
          but if you do get that vibe I encourage you to ask any of my close friends
          or roommates - they'll be the first to tell you that I'm really just a piece
          of shit like the rest of them :)
