    <h1> Who created God? </h1>
    <p>
      If you spend some time to think about it, it’s actually a valid question.
      Who created God? If God created us, then wouldn’t something have to have created him?

      <br><br>
      In all honesty, the question just reinforces the fact the humans are drawn
      to a creator. We think all things must have a beginning because <i>we</i> had a
      beginning. In reality, we don’t have the correct perception of time; it’s like explaining color to
      a blind man, or pain to someone who feels nothing. We only know time relative
      to our experience, and <i>our experience</i> has a beginning.

      <br><br>
      From what we can see, humanity is the greatest thing this world has to offer.
      No other creation is nearly as intelligent. However, I would hate to actually
      believe this! Honestly, we are nowhere near as intelligent as some of us think.
      I watched a YouTube video once where a man drew a circle on a whiteboard and
      said it represented all of the knowledge the world had to offer. Everything,
      even above human understanding, belonged inside that circle. He then asked the
      hypothetical audience to shade in a correct amount representing how much of
      this knowledge they knew. To be honest, even if we took all of humanity, with
      knowing how vast this world is I doubt we could all even shade in half of it
      (and that’s extremely generous!). How much can a single person know of
      everything the world has to offer?

      <br><br>
      How much is really out there that we don’t even know about? We have senses
      for sight, hearing, feeling, taste, even somewhat of a sense of time. What
      if there is stuff out there which we don’t have a sense for? If we didn’t
      have ears would we know about sound? If we didn’t have eyes would we know
      about color? Would we be able to know about something even if we weren’t
      created to?

      <br><br>
      So in short, who created God?

      <br><br>
      Nobody created God! He is so far out of our understanding that it is difficult
      for us to comprehend how something can not have a beginning. Our lack of
      understanding of God is why we can’t ‘prove’ he exists. We just look to the
      evidence. Sure, something or someone could have created God, but there is no
      evidence for it so I will disregard it. Sure, Tupac could still be alive, but
      likewise where is the evidence? Now, although humans are not smart enough
      to pick up these senses of God, do we then conclude that he doesn’t exist? Do we
      disregard the writings of the early Christians, the life of Jesus, the fact
      that each of his disciples changed in such ways that they were martyred,
      <i>murdered</i> for the sake of the gospel?

      <br><br>
      I really don’t want to continue because I don’t want to be that guy, but I
      encourage you to think on your own of evidence of a God.

      <br><br>
      One last thought - humans really do have a sense for God, we just have to
      tune it to the right channel. Sin severs this sense. Have you ever felt Him
      calling you? Maybe when your heart is about to beat of your chest, or you
      are brought to tears by the Holy Spirit? He will reveal himself to you! Just
      make the effort and ask him!

      <br><br>
      <i>"Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door
      will be opened to you." - Matthew 7:7 (NIV) </i>

      <br><br>
      <i>"For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal
         power and divine nature--have been clearly seen" - Romans 1:20a (NIV) </i>
