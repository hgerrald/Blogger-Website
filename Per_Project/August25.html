    <h1> Extraordinary Evidence </h1>
    <p>
      Extraordinary events require extraordinary evidence. Consequently, events of
      lesser exceptionality require less evidence to believe. If I were to tell you
      Clemson beat Furman in football you wouldn’t think anything of it, but on
      the other hand, if I were to tell you they lost you would nose-dive for your
      phone to look up the score for yourself. If the only evidence for us ever
      landing on the moon or Donald Trump being elected president was just word
      of mouth, personally I would have trouble believing them myself.
      They require much evidence because each can be unimaginable (I have no
      political preference I just still can't believe he pulled it off haha)
      <br><br>

      Would not the most extraordinary of all things also follow this principle?
      Would not the idea of a God, so loving that He set about a purpose for us
      since the beginning of time, so powerful that we are but pawns in his knitted
      universe, require the most evidence to believe?
      <br><br>

      In fact, Jesus’ miracles were so exceptional even John the Baptist doubted him.
      The man sent to make way for Jesus, who baptized him, and who claimed the
      sandals of whom he was unworthy to untie (Luke 3:16) could not fully fathom
      him. In Luke 7, Jesus raises a widow’s son from the dead, and John responds
      by sending two of his disciples to ask if he is the true Messiah or if
      someone else is to come. <i>John had not seen these miracles with his own eyes,
      and even he could not fully believe them.</i>
      <br><br>

      Jesus’ response?
      <br><br>

      <i>“Go back and report to John what <b>you have seen and heard:</b> The blind
      receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf
      hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor”</i>
      - Luke (7:22).
      <br><br>

      It was seemingly too good to be true, even for John!!
      <br><br>

      <b>God is so outstanding, so marvelous and extraordinary, no amount of evidence
      can satisfy our craving to believe.</b> He is the highest standard of greatness.
      Think of it like this: His goodness, glory, and love are so great, on first
      hearing of it, it would be like checking one million websites to confirm the
      score of a game because you sincerely could not believe it.
      <br><br>

      There is evidence for him, tons of it, but because he is so great we cannot
      find enough.
      <br><br>

      Jesus didn’t preach so much about faith because he wanted us to have faith
      in something that isn’t true. We need faith because He is too great to take in!
