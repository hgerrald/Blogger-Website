    <h1> What is Purity? </h1>
    <p>
      For the longest time I thought purity was abstaining from sin. I thought it
      meant abstaining from sex. I thought it was something we are supposed to
      strive for but can’t really achieve, and because of this I never really
      thought I could live a pure life or at times even cared to. Why strive for
      the impossible?
      <br><br>

      Last night I watched as the Holy Spirit spoke to me through a friend. I sat
      in awe as words came out of his mouth in a way that I’ve never witnessed
      before in him.
      <br><br>

      There is good news, news you probably won’t believe if you’re just now
      learning of it. Jesus’ death makes us pure! <i>PURE!</i> He cleansed the sin
      for us; all we have to do is allow him to!
      <br><br>

      If you’re still not completely bought in, let me share with you a quick story.
      I was talking to a close friend a while ago about forgiveness and asked him
      this question: “If God doesn’t forgive us (by sending people to hell) unless
      we ask and repent, should I forgive those who have wronged me if they don’t
      first apologize?” His response was gold.
      <br><br>

      “God has already forgiven us before we even ask. He wants to cleanse us, but
      we have to choose to let him. If we don’t accept Jesus then we can’t accept
      his cleansing; we can’t be made pure.”
      <br><br>

      Heaven is perfect, and in order for us to be reunited with God, we too must
      be perfect. If you don’t want to be, then because of God’s gift of free will
      we don’t have to be.
      <br><br>

      However, the moment you accept Christ as your saviour you are forever pure!
      You are made perfect so that you can be reunited with God, and listen, it
      gets even better.
      <br><br>

      This is how much God loves us: because we are pure he considers us co-heirs
      with Christ!
      <br><br>

      <i>“The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children.
      Now if we are children, then we are heirs - heirs of God and co-heirs with
      Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share
      in his glory.” - Romans 8:16-17</i>
      <br><br>

      How can someone love us <i>that</i> much?! How can we be considered co-heirs
      with the one who is responsible for cleansing us??
      <br><br>

      Brother or sister, you do not need to feel remorse, shame, or think that
      purity is impossible or not worth it. <i>You are breathing purity.</i>
      <br><br>

      If you are one with Christ you are no longer convicted because of sin. Sin
      is used as conviction for those who do not believe in Christ to bring them
      closer to Him. We are convicted because we know we are righteous, yet we are
      living otherwise (John 16:8-11). We may not be able to live a perfect life,
      but the more righteous you realize you are, the less of a desire you will
      have to turn back to your old ways.
