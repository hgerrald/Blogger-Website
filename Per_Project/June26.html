      Where do I even begin on this one?

      <br><br>
      At times it seems like the only question that people care about, and at
      others people overthink it so much that it seems there is no clear answer.

      <br><br>
      What is the meaning of life? Why are we here?

      <br><br>
      This is a bold topic to write about, but like most of my writings, this is
      for me. I love to write, to express my ideas and thoughts that at times I
      can’t explain without deep thought. Everyone will have their own version of
      what they think is right - this is just mine.

      <br><br>
      Let's start with a backstory, and it has to do with an out-of-body experience,
      a sensation of being outside one's own body and able to observe from a distance.
      Those closest to me know that I’m a skeptic by nature, so I initially doubt until
      I’m given reason to believe. I will say though, my grandmother had an-out-of
      body experience when she was 18. Sadly, she is no longer around today for me
      to ask her about it, but I do remember talking to her about it before she passed.
      However, knowing this I still call BS when I initially hear of someone else’s
      experience. I do believe my grandmother- she didn't tell anyone except her
      doctor for 30 years because she knew how crazy it sounded! (and she was the
      sweetest lady on the planet)- but I'm still reluctant to believe most things
      I hear. Come to think of it, I'm not too sure how she would feel about me sharing
      her story today.

      <br><br>
      Recently I watched a YouTube clip about a man’s out-of-body experience. Trust
      me, I am a skeptic, and as I watched it I was analyzing everything he said to
      find any truth. He says that he left his body during a surgery (similar to my
      grandma’s experience) and met with God in heaven. God stood behind him talking
      to him and asked him if he had any questions, but this man couldn’t think of
      any! (like come on bro I have a list of them). After gathering his thoughts,
      he went ahead and asked him the most cliché question, “what is the meaning of
      life?” He says that God just laughed and told him a lot of people ask him
      that, but the answer is so simple, and God said he would tell him next time.

      <br><br>
      BRO! What kind of joke is that?! Next time? But putting that aside, honestly,
      the thing that caught my attention the most was God’s response! How is it
      so simple when it’s such a frequently asked question?

      <br><br>
      This man, I believe his name was Richard, said he walked out of the hospital
      9 days later despite having a 10% chance of living. About a week later he
      was confronted by a man who claimed to have had a similar experience and asked
      God the same question. This man agreed, the answer was simple! When Richard
      asked him the question he responded, “Oh that’s easy, it’s all about love.”

      <br><br>
      <i>Love.</i>

      <br><br>
      The strongest emotion a human can feel. The one single thing that every person,
      despite culture, race, social status, income, etc., can agree that they
      desire. The one single thing stronger than hate. The feeling that can
      drive a man to do literally anything. For a while (until now if I’m going
      to be completely honest here) I thought that the most important of the
      10 commandments was to love God and to love your neighbor. But God did not
      give these in the 10 commandments he gave to the Israelites as they left
      Egypt. These two commands are hidden in a list of many of other commands
      God gave the Israelites in Leviticus 19 and Deuteronomy 6 (I googled this).

      <br><br>
      It was when Jesus came that we received a nice hint as to the meaning of life.
      In one incident, a Pharisee asked Jesus, “Teacher, which is the greatest
      commandment in the Law?” This event is recorded in all four gospels, which
      should show that the early Christians knew just how important Jesus’ response
      was.

      <br><br>
      <i>Jesus replied: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your
      soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And
      the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the
      Prophets hang on these two commandments.”</i> - Matthew 22:37-40

      <br><br>
      Jesus told us that the most important thing for us to do is love. We were
      made to love.

      <br><br>
      If you too are a skeptic I urge you to ask yourself this question: is there
      anything you wouldn’t do for someone you love?

      <br><br>
      Christians teach that God is love and made us out of love. He yearns for us
      to love him, and he wishes for us to love each other. When we feel the most
      complete, isn't it when we are doing something or are with someone we love?
      What good is everything else if we don't have it?

      <br><br><br><br>
      Here's the link to the video if you want to watch it. I don't know whether
      I truly believe it or not, but his experience was similar to my grandma's.
      Honestly, I find no reason not to as everything he says lines up with what
      I believe God would say to us (but I still don't like the whole 'next time' part!!)
