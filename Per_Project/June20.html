      What if God told you today that he has huge plans for you tomorrow? That he
      wanted to do something so incredible in your life, with your life, or use
      you in such a way that you immediately dropped to your knees because you knew
      how unworthy you are. What if He is molding you today, putting you through
      hell that others are not, so that you can do tomorrow what they can’t?

      <br><br>
      <i>“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper
      you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future”- Jeremiah 29:11</i>

      <br><br>
      Now what if he told you that this season of preparation must first last one
      year for it to come to fruition? Would you still persevere for the Lord?
      Would you still finish the good race? Would you let the hand of our almighty
      father and creator mold you as he wishes or would you follow your own desires,
      those that Paul calls the desires of the flesh?

      <br><br>
      <i>Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of
      many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.
      Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete,
      not lacking anything. - James 1:2-4 </i>

      <br><br>
      My call today is to finish the good race. I have no idea what’s waiting for
      me at the finish line. A couple months ago God gave me a taste of His plan
      and the result brought me to tears. I can only imagine how now, after persevering
      in this manner, knowing how difficult the journey has been, how sweet the taste
      of perfect love and pure rejoicing directed from my father God will be at
      the end of this season.
