    <h1> Why do I doubt God? - Luke 1</h1>
    <p>
      Two angels appear in two distinct instances in Luke 1. In verse 11 an angel
      appears to Zechariah, a priest and the eventual father of John the Baptist,
      inside the temple of the Lord. On first sight, Zechariah is startled and
      gripped with fear, but the angel encourages him, “Do not be afraid. Your
      prayer has been heard”. The angel foretells how Zechariah and his wife Elizabeth
      will have a son, despite their old age, and that he will “be filled with the
      Holy Spirit even before he is born.” <b>Despite Zechariah seeing this with his
      own eyes, he doubts what he sees and hears!</b> He responds, “How can I be sure
      of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.” This is a similar
      experience as found in Genesis with Abram and Sarah, but in contrast, “Abram
      believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness” (Genesis 15:6).
      Abram was unlike any other man in his time, his faith was incredible and the
      Lord blessed him tremendously.

     <br><br>
      The second angel appears to Mary, the eventual mother of Jesus. The angel
      explains to Mary that she will conceive and give birth to the Son of the Most
      High, but like Zechariah she too doubts! Mary asked the angel, “How will this
      be, since I am a virgin?”

      <br><br>
      How easy is it to doubt our God? Zechariah and Mary were both righteous people
      favored by God, and they had an angel of the Lord <i>appear in front of their very
      eyes! </i>Yet their natural response, despite seeing something this incredible,
      is to doubt. Does this not foretell that we too, having </i>not seen such a
      phenomena with our earthly eyes, should struggle with this even more? When
      we do not have full trust in the Lord it becomes easy to doubt.

      <br><br>
      <i>Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed
      are those who have not seen and yet have believed."</i> - John 20:29

      <br><br>
      Unlike Abram, Sarah laughed to herself when she learned of God’s promise to
      bless her with a child despite her old age. God’s response?

      <br><br>
      “Is anything too hard for the Lord?” (Genesis 18:14).

      <br><br>
      <i>Is anything too difficult for our crafter?! </i>
